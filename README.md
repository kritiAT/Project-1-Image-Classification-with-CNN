# Project 1: Image Classification with CNN

## About
This project implements and evaluates multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Three models, including a transfer learning approach based on MobileNetV2, are compared to identify the best-performing architecture.

## Problem Statement
- Dataset used: CIFAR-10
- Task: Multi-class image classification
- Goal: Train a model that can classify 10 object categories from RGB images.

## Model Architecture
This project explores multiple CNN variants and selects a transfer learning model based on MobileNetV2.

**Final architecture (MobileNetV2-based):**
- Input: images resized to 96×96 RGB
- MobileNetV2 base (Initially frozen)
- Custom Conv2D(64, 3×3, ReLU) - feature learning
- BatchNormalization + Dropout(0.3)
- GlobalAveragePooling
- Dense(256, ReLU) → Dense(10, Softmax)
- Fine-tuned last 30 layers of the base model
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001) | Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
- Preprocessing: MobileNetV2 `preprocess_input` on RGB pixel values
- Metrics: Accuracy

### Other candidate models
- Model 1: Baseline CNN with a single convolutional layer
- Model 2: Deeper CNN with 4 convolution layers blocks, batch normalization, dropout, and pooling
- Model 3: MobileNetV2 transfer learning (selected final model)

## Results
The candidate models were compared using test performance. The MobileNetV2 transfer learning model achieved the best results.

| Model               | Test Accuracy |  Test Loss |
| ------------------- | ------------: | ---------: |
| Baseline CNN        |        61.21% |     1.2387 |
| Deep CNN            |        80.89% |     0.5656 |
| MobileNetV2 (Final) |    **88.84%** | **0.3332** |

## Evaluation

The final model was evaluated using:

- Test accuracy
- Test loss
- Confusion matrix
- Per-class predictions
- Visualization of misclassified images

##### Saved model
- The final model was saved as `models/final_model.keras`.
- A confusion matrix was generated to inspect per-class predictions.
- Misclassified images were displayed in a plot.
